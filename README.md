This is a rhythm game written in Python using PyGame. 

The main feature is that it now has (limited) support of all the Beat Saber levels (a very popular game in the music genre, but available only in VR). 

Theoretically, you can download any level from [BeatSaver](beatsaver.com), unpack it, place under ./levels folder and just play! For now only the most basic features are supported, but it's enough to have fun :)

The concept is very basic: it's a 2D scroller where you can switch between 4 lines. Notes are approaching you, and if you will hit right in the beat of the song, you'll get a lot of points. Use scoreboard and challenge your friends :)

Some preventive measures have been taken for trivial ways to play (such as clicking all the possible buttons all the time). Some math has been used to keep the song in sync no matter what's the FPS, so you should be in a good shape unless you've got a potato PC. Check it out yourself!
